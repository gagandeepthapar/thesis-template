abstract={This paper describes and discusses the preprocessing and calibration of the magnetic data taken by the navigational magnetometers onboard the two GRACE satellites, with focus on the almost 10 years period f    rom January 2008 to the end of the GRACE mission in October 2017 for which 1-Hz magnetic data are available. A calibration of the magnetic data is performed by comparing the raw magnetometer sensor readings with     model magnetic vector values as provided by the CHAOS-7 geomagnetic field model for the time and position of the GRACE data. The presented approach also accounts for magnetic disturbances produced by the satellit    e's magnetorquer and for temperature effects, which are parametrized by the Sun incident angle. The root-mean-squared error of the difference between the calibrated data and CHAOS-7 model values is about 10 nT, w    hich makes the GRACE magnetometer data relevant for geophysical investigations.},

  abstract = {Abstract We apply multivariate error-propagation analysis to color-signal transformations. Results are given that indicate how linear, matrix, and nonlinear transformations influence the mean, variance, and covariance of color-measurements and color-images. Since many signal processing paths include these steps, the analysis is applicable to color-measurement and imaging systems. Expressions are given that allow image noise or error propagation for a spectrophotometer, colorimeter, or digital camera. In a computed example, error statistics are propagated from tristimulus values to CIELAB coordinates. The resulting signal covariance is interpreted in terms of CIELAB error ellipsoids and the mean value of color-difference measures, \$\Delta \rm{E}^{*}\_{\hbox{ab}}\$ and \$\Delta \rm{E}^{*}\_{94}\$. The application of this analysis to system design is also illustrated by relating a \$\Delta \rm{E}^{*}\_{94}\$ tolerance to equivalent tristimulus-value error statistics. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

@article{MonteCarloAnalysis,
	abstract = {It has been reported that the Monte Carlo Method has many advantages over conventional methods in the estimation of uncertainty, especially that of complex measurement systems' outputs. The method, superficially, is relatively simple to implement, and is slowly gaining industrial acceptance. Unfortunately, very little has been published on how the method works. To those who are uninitiated, this powerful approach remains a `black art'. This paper demonstrates that the Monte Carlo simulation method is fully compatible with the conventional uncertainty estimation methods for linear systems and systems that have small uncertainties. Monte Carlo simulation has the ability to take account of partial correlated measurement input uncertainties. It also examines the uncertainties of the results of some basic manipulations e.g. addition, multiplication and division, of two input measured variables which may or may not be correlated. For correlated input measurements, the probability distribution of the result could be biased or skewed. These properties cannot be revealed using conventional methods.},
