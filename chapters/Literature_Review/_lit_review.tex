\chapter{Bullet Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item CubeSat Budget VS Star Tracker Cost \cite{SmallSatMarket}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Figure of cost VS accuracy 
        \item Various other sensors and costs i.e., sun sensors (reflected in figure with different shapes)
    \end{itemize} 
    \item CubeSat Mission requirements that show the attitude requirements \cite{CubeSatCLICK, OnOrbitBeamCalibration} 
    \item History of CubeSat attitude requirements and previous solutions and how they evolved into modern-day requirements
    \begin{itemize}
    \item need to spend an arm and a leg or fail on requirements 
    \end{itemize}
        \item Why the error propagation is the right way to trade on cost/performance 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item talk about the other methods and why they fall short  
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
