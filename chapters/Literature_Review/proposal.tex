\section{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item CPCL already developing a star tracker to deploy in orbit and open sourcing the software 
    \item Would be useful for other universities and low-budget developers to be able to determine if star tracker is worth putting money into 
    \item Allows cubesats to stay competitive in the maturing spacecraft market 
\end{itemize}

\section{Contribution to the Field}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No other tool to determine star tracker accuracy 
    \item Focused on CubeSats i.e., low-cost, low-size 
    \item Allows cubesat developers to estimate their accuracy to determine if a low cost star tracker is inline with the pointing direction
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Find models relating effects to star tracker accuracy 
    \item Combine models where appropriate (i.e., thermal effect on focal length where $f$ becomes a function instead of a constant)
    \item Determine how effects affect the star tracker (i.e., during the centroiding process will propagate from there on)
    \item Determine how accurate each physical process can be at its max as a function of the different effects
    \item Create black box based on Monte Carlo analysis looking at discrete sets of camera characteristics and continuous sets of physical properties to estimate star tracker accuracy
    \item Devise cost function based on community needs and use black box to suggest optimal camera and environment opportunities 
\end{itemize}

\section{Success Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Black box where various inputs (camera properties, environment, etc.) are fed to estimate star tracker accuracy with some confidence level
    \item Black box is opened up to show models and how it affects each step in attitude determination 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finding models
    \item Combining models 
    \item Devising the cost function 
\end{itemize}

\par \qquad The literature offers several suggestions in analyzing the error propagation within the sensor such as hardware considerations, "thermal drift, optical aberration, detector noise"\cite{systematic_error_analysis_of_star_tracker_centroiding}, and systematic algorithmic errors.
However, before we can analyze where error is prone to occur, we must first understand what a star tracker is and how they work.
