\par \qquad The literature offers several suggestions in analyzing the error propagation within the sensor such as hardware considerations, "thermal drift, optical aberration, detector noise"\cite{systematic_error_analysis_of_star_tracker_centroiding}, and systematic algorithmic errors.
However, before we can analyze where error is prone to occur, we must first understand what a star tracker is and how they work.
